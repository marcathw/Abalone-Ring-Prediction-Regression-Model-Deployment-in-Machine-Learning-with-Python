# Abalone-Ring-Prediction-Regression-Model-Deployment-in-Machine-Learning-with-Python
This project builds a regression model using Linear Regression to estimate the number of rings of abalone from physical measurements. The trained model is deployed using FastAPI, providing a lightweight RESTful API for prediction.
